// This code demonstrates the difference between string and number types in TypeScript.
// It shows how TypeScript handles addition and concatenation of these types.
// It uses TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety and prevent errors in operations involving different types.
// The code is concise, type-safe, and easy to extend with new strategies.

// let a = 5;
// let b = "6";

// console.log(a + b);

let a: number = 5;
let b: number = 6;
console.log(a + b);
