In Docker's layered architecture, how are changes to an image managed to optimize space and speed?
Option 1: Changes are appended at the top layerChanges are appended at the top layer
Option 2: Changes are overwritten in the base imageChanges are overwritten in the base image
Option 3: Changes are managed through version controlChanges are managed through version control
Option 4: Changes are stored in a separate imageChanges are stored in a separate image
Correct Response:1.0
Explanation:In Docker's layered architecture, changes to an image are managed by appending them at the top layer. Each layer is read-only, and new changes are added in subsequent layers. This approach optimizes space and speed because unchanged layers can be reused, and only the modified layers need to be stored or transmitted, enhancing efficiency in image management.
