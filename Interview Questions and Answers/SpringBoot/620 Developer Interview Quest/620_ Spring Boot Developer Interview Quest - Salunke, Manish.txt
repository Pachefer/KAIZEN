Option 3: To allow configuration classes.

Option 4: To define a main method.




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: The @SpringBootApplication annotation in Spring Boot is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. Thus, it enables component scanning, allowing Spring to automatically discover and register beans. This is crucial for allowing the Spring context to be aware of all the components, services, repositories, etc. available in the project.





Question: Which of the following annotations is used to mark a class as a source of bean definitions?

Option 1: @Entity

Option 2: @Repository

Option 3: @Service

Option 4: @Configuration




Correct Response: 4

Explanation: The @Configuration annotation is used to mark a class as a source of bean definitions. This means that any method annotated with @Bean within a class annotated with @Configuration will define a bean in the Spring context, allowing it to be injected into other components, services, etc. This is fundamental for creating the beans that make up the application context in a Spring application.





Question: What is the primary file used to define properties in Spring Boot?

Option 1: application.properties

Option 2: application.yml

Option 3: bootstrap.properties

Option 4: config.properties




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the application.properties file is the primary file used to define properties. This file allows you to configure various aspects of the application, such as server port, database connections, etc. The application.properties file is typically located in the src/main/resources directory, and its properties are loaded at runtime by Spring Boot. The properties defined in this file can also be overridden by external configurations.





Question: How can application properties be overridden in Spring Boot for different environments?

Option 1: Using environment-specific property files.

Option 2: By modifying the application.properties directly.

Option 3: By annotating the @OverrideProperties annotation on the class.

Option 4: By creating multiple instances of the SpringApplication class.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: Application properties in Spring Boot can be overridden for different environments by using environment-specific property files. By naming these files application-{profile}.properties (e.g., application-dev.properties for the 'dev' profile), Spring Boot can load the properties specific to the active profile, allowing you to configure different settings for each environment. This is a key feature for maintaining configurations across various deployment scenarios.





Question: Which annotation is used to inject a bean dependency into a Spring component?

Option 1: @Autowired

Option 2: @Inject

Option 3: @Component

Option 4: @Bean




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The @Autowired annotation is used to inject a bean dependency into a Spring component. It enables automatic injection of dependencies by type. When a bean of the required type is available in the Spring context, it will be injected into the annotated field or constructor parameter. This annotation simplifies the process of wiring components together in a Spring application.





Question: How can you change the default port number of the embedded web server in a Spring Boot application?

Option 1: By modifying the server.port property in the application.properties file.

Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To conditionally exclude specific Auto Configurations, you can use the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property in your application.properties or application.yml file. This property allows you to specify the fully qualified names of the Auto Configuration classes you want to exclude. The other options do not provide a direct way to conditionally exclude Auto Configurations.





Question: When creating a custom Auto Configuration, how do you ensure that it is processed after a specific Auto Configuration?

Option 1: By using the @AutoConfigureAfter annotation and specifying the class or classes that should be processed before.

Option 2: By setting the spring.autoconfigure.order property in application.properties or application.yml to control the order of Auto Configuration processing.

Option 3: By using the @DependsOn annotation and specifying the names of the beans that should be created before the custom Auto Configuration.

Option 4: By extending the AutoConfigurationSorter class and implementing custom sorting logic based on your requirements.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: You can ensure that a custom Auto Configuration is processed after a specific Auto Configuration by using the @AutoConfigureAfter annotation and specifying the class or classes that should be processed before your custom configuration. This allows you to define the order of Auto Configuration processing. The other options do not provide a direct way to control the order of Auto Configuration.





Question: How can you customize the conditions under which a bean is created within a custom Auto Configuration?

Option 1: By using the @ConditionalOnProperty annotation and specifying the property conditions for bean creation.

Option 2: By using the @Conditional annotation and specifying a custom condition class that determines when the bean should be created.

Option 3: By using the @BeanCondition annotation and defining custom conditions in a separate configuration class.

Option 4: By setting the bean.creation.condition property in application.properties or application.yml with custom conditions.




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: You can customize the conditions under which a bean is created within a custom Auto Configuration by using the @Conditional annotation and specifying a custom condition class. This condition class can determine when the bean should be created based on your criteria. While @ConditionalOnProperty is a valid annotation for conditional bean creation, it is primarily used at the class level to conditionally enable the entire configuration class, not for individual bean conditions. The other options do not provide a standard way to customize bean creation conditions.





Question: In Spring Boot, the _____ annotation is used to conditionally enable a configuration based on the presence of a specific property.

Option 1: @ConditionalOnProperty

Option 2: @ConfigurationProperties

Option 3: @EnableAutoConfiguration

Option 4: @ComponentScan




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the "@ConditionalOnProperty" annotation is used to conditionally enable a configuration based on the presence of a specific property. This annotation allows you to configure components or beans based on the values of properties, making it a powerful tool for conditional configuration in your application.





Question: The _____ file is crucial for defining custom Auto Configuration classes in Spring Boot.

Option 1: application.yml

Option 2: application.properties

Option 3: autoconfigure.properties

Option 4: AutoConfiguration.java




Correct Response: 4

Explanation: The "AutoConfiguration.java" file is crucial for defining custom Auto Configuration classes in Spring Boot. This is where you can define your own auto-configuration classes to customize the behavior of Spring Boot's auto-configuration process. Custom Auto Configuration classes are typically Java classes, and this file plays a central role in configuring them.





Question: Custom Auto Configurations are usually defined in a separate _____ to avoid being included by component scanning.

Option 1: @Configuration

Option 2: package

Option 3: ApplicationContext

Option 4: @ConditionalOnClass




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: Custom Auto Configurations are usually defined in a separate "package" to avoid being included by component scanning. By placing your custom Auto Configuration classes in a separate package, you can control which classes are picked up by component scanning and ensure that your custom configurations are only applied when explicitly required.





Question: To create conditional beans within custom Auto Configuration, you can use the @_____ annotation with a specific condition.

Option 1: ConditionalOnBean

Option 2: ConditionalOnProperty

Option 3: ConditionalOnClass

Option 4: ConditionalOnMethod




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: To create conditional beans within custom Auto Configuration, you can use the @ConditionalOnClass annotation. This annotation allows you to specify that a particular bean should be created only if a specified class is present in the classpath. It's useful for scenarios where you want to conditionally configure beans based on the availability of certain classes.





Question: The ordering of Auto Configurations can be controlled using the @_____ annotation or property.

Option 1: Order

Option 2: AutoConfigureOrder

Option 3: ConditionalOnProperty

Option 4: ConfigurationOrder




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: The ordering of Auto Configurations can be controlled using the @AutoConfigureOrder annotation or the spring.autoconfigure.order property. This allows you to specify the order in which Auto Configurations should be applied during the application startup process. The lower the value, the earlier the configuration is applied.





Question: If you want to specify that a configuration will be applied only if a specific class is present, you would use the @_____ annotation in Spring Boot.

Option 1: ConditionalOnMissingBean

Option 2: ConditionalOnProperty

Option 3: ConditionalOnClass

Option 4: ConditionalOnMethod




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: If you want to specify that a configuration will be applied only if a specific class is present, you would use the @ConditionalOnClass annotation in Spring Boot. This annotation allows you to conditionally apply a configuration based on the presence of a specified class in the classpath. It helps in creating flexible and conditional configurations.





Question: You are designing a large-scale application using Spring Boot where different modules require different Auto Configurations. How would you organize and manage these Auto Configurations to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance?

Option 1: Create separate Auto Configuration classes for each module and use @ConditionalOnClass or @ConditionalOnProperty annotations to enable/disable them based on the module's requirements.

Option 2: Include all Auto Configuration logic in a single class to avoid clutter and confusion.

Option 3: Use XML-based configuration files to define Auto Configurations for each module.

Option 4: Define Auto Configurations within the application's main class to keep everything in one place.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To ensure modularity and ease of maintenance, it's best practice to create separate Auto Configuration classes for each module. You can then use @ConditionalOnClass or @ConditionalOnProperty annotations to enable or disable them based on the specific module's requirements. This approach keeps the configurations modular and makes it easier to manage and maintain them in a large-scale application.





Question: You are tasked with creating a custom Auto Configuration that provides a set of beans only if a specific library is on the classpath. How would you approach this requirement?

Option 1: Use the @ConditionalOnClass annotation on the custom Auto Configuration class and specify the library's class in the annotation's value attribute. This ensures that the beans are created only if the specified class is on the classpath.

Option 2: Include the library's JAR file directly in the project to guarantee its presence and enable the beans.

Option 3: Use the @ConditionalOnProperty annotation with a condition that checks for the presence of the library's JAR file.

Option 4: Create the beans unconditionally, and Spring Boot will automatically handle the classpath check.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To create a custom Auto Configuration that provides beans conditionally based on the presence of a specific library on the classpath, you should use the @ConditionalOnClass annotation. Specify the library's class in the annotation's value attribute. This approach ensures that the beans are only created when the specified class is available on the classpath, ensuring the required conditions are met.





Question: Your application has several Auto Configurations, and you notice that some beans are being overridden unintentionally. How would you resolve the bean overriding issue and ensure that the intended beans are registered?

Option 1: Use the @Primary annotation on the intended bean definition to make it the primary candidate for injection, resolving potential conflicts.

Option 2: Remove one of the conflicting Auto Configurations from the project to eliminate the possibility of bean overriding.

Option 3: Rename the beans to ensure they have unique names, preventing accidental overriding.

Option 4: Adjust the bean scope to be prototype for the intended beans to avoid conflicts.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To resolve bean overriding issues and ensure that the intended beans are registered, you can use the @Primary annotation on the bean definition of the intended bean. This annotation marks the bean as the primary candidate for injection when there are conflicts, ensuring that it's selected over others. It's a common way to resolve unintentional bean overriding in Spring Boot applications.





Question: In Spring Boot, which annotation is used to wire beans in the IoC container?

Option 1: @Inject

Option 2: @Autowired

Option 3: @Resource

Option 4: @Bean




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the @Autowired annotation is commonly used to wire (inject) beans into the IoC (Inversion of Control) container. It allows Spring to automatically identify and inject dependencies into the respective components. While the other annotations (@Inject, @Resource, and @Bean) are related to dependency injection or bean definition, @Autowired is the primary annotation used for this purpose.





Question: Which of the following annotations is specifically used for injecting dependencies on setter methods?

Option 1: @Inject

Option 2: @Autowired

Option 3: @Resource

Option 4: @Setter




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: Among the provided options, the @Autowired annotation is specifically used for injecting dependencies on setter methods in Spring. When you apply @Autowired to a setter method, Spring will automatically inject the required dependencies into that setter method. The other annotations have different purposes, such as @Inject and @Resource are more generic dependency injection annotations, and @Setter is not a standard Spring annotation for dependency injection.





Question: Which annotation is used to define a bean in the Spring context?

Option 1: @Inject

Option 2: @Component

Option 3: @Service

Option 4: @Bean




Correct Response: 4

Explanation: The @Bean annotation is used to define a bean in the Spring context. When you annotate a method with @Bean, it tells Spring that the method should be used to create and configure a bean. This is commonly used for defining custom beans in Java-based Spring configurations. The other annotations (@Inject, @Component, and @Service) have different purposes and are not used for defining beans in the same way as @Bean.





Question: How can you specify that a bean should be injected with a specific qualifier when there are multiple candidates?

Option 1: Using the @Qualifier annotation.

Option 2: By using the @Inject annotation.

Option 3: Utilizing the @Autowired annotation.

Option 4: By configuring the application.properties file.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: You can specify that a bean should be injected with a specific qualifier when there are multiple candidates by using the @Qualifier annotation in Spring. This annotation helps Spring identify which candidate bean should be injected into the target. The other options, such as @Inject and @Autowired, are used for dependency injection but do not directly deal with qualifier-based injection. The application.properties file is typically used for configuration and not for specifying bean injection.





Question: In what scenario would you prefer to use @Inject over @Autowired for dependency injection?

Option 1: When using Java EE components or environments.

Option 2: When you want to inject dependencies by name.

Option 3: When you need to inject dependencies conditionally.

Option 4: When working with Spring Boot applications.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: You would prefer to use @Inject over @Autowired for dependency injection when using Java EE components or environments. @Inject is a standard Java EE annotation for dependency injection, while @Autowired is more specific to Spring. In a Java EE context, it's recommended to use @Inject for better portability. The other options may not be the primary reasons for choosing @Inject over @Autowired.





Question: How can you manage bean lifecycle events, such as initialization and destruction, in Spring Boot?

Option 1: By using the @Bean annotation with @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy methods.

Option 2: By declaring beans in an XML configuration file.

Option 3: By using the @Service annotation with initMethod and destroyMethod attributes.

Option 4: By configuring bean lifecycles in the main application class constructor.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: You can manage bean lifecycle events, such as initialization and destruction, in Spring Boot by using the @Bean annotation along with @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy methods. These methods allow you to specify custom initialization and destruction logic for your beans. The other options mentioned (XML configuration, @Service with initMethod and destroyMethod, and configuring lifecycles in the main application class constructor) are not the recommended or common approaches for managing bean lifecycles in Spring Boot.





Question: How can you create a shared bean that is not a singleton in Spring Boot?

Option 1: Using the @Scope annotation with prototype.

Option 2: Declaring the bean as @Singleton.

Option 3: Configuring the bean as a @RequestScoped bean.

Option 4: Creating a bean without any scope annotation.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring Boot, you can create a shared bean that is not a singleton by using the @Scope annotation with prototype. This means a new instance of the bean will be created every time it is requested. The other options either create a singleton bean (Option 2) or are not valid ways to achieve a shared bean with a different scope (Options 3 and 4).





Question: How can you resolve circular dependencies between beans in Spring Boot?

Option 1: Using @Lazy annotation to delay bean initialization.

Option 2: Ensuring that all beans depend on each other.

Option 3: Setting the application context to auto-detect-circular-dependencies: true.

Option 4: Using the @DependsOn annotation to specify bean dependencies explicitly.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: Circular dependencies can be resolved in Spring Boot by using the @Lazy annotation to delay the initialization of beans involved in the circular dependency. This allows Spring to break the circular reference. The other options do not effectively resolve circular dependencies and may lead to issues.





Question: In what cases would you choose constructor injection over setter injection, and why?

Option 1: When you need to inject dependencies that are immutable and required for the object to function properly.

Option 2: When you want to inject dependencies after the object is created.

Option 3: Constructor injection should always be preferred over setter injection.

Option 4: When you need to inject dependencies that may change during the object's lifecycle.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: Constructor injection is preferred over setter injection when you need to inject dependencies that are immutable and required for the object to function properly. This ensures that the object is in a valid state from the moment it is created. Setter injection is more suitable when you want to inject optional or mutable dependencies after the object is constructed. The other options are not accurate reasons for choosing one injection method over the other.





Question: To specify that a bean should only be created under a specific condition, you would use the _____ annotation in Spring Boot.

Option 1: @ConditionalBean

Option 2: @ConditionalOnProperty

Option 3: @ConditionalOnClass

Option 4: @ConditionalOnCondition




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the "@ConditionalOnProperty" annotation is used to specify that a bean should be created only under a specific condition based on the values of specified properties. This is a powerful feature that allows developers to control bean creation based on property values, making the application's configuration more flexible and adaptable. The other options are not the correct annotations for this purpose.





Question: The _____ annotation in Spring Boot is used to designate a specific bean to be autowired when there are multiple candidates.

Option 1: @AutowireBean

Option 2: @Autowired

Option 3: @Primary

Option 4: @Qualifier




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the "@Primary" annotation is used to designate a specific bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when there are multiple candidates for the same type. This is particularly useful when you have multiple beans of the same type, and you want to specify which one should be injected by default. The other options are related to autowiring but do not serve this specific purpose.





Question: When defining a bean, the _____ annotation can be used to specify the method to invoke when the application context is closed.

Option 1: @OnClose

Option 2: @PreDestroy

Option 3: @DestroyMethod

Option 4: @PostConstruct




Correct Response: 4

Explanation: In Spring, the "@PreDestroy" annotation can be used to specify a method that should be invoked when the application context is closed or when the bean is being destroyed. This allows you to perform cleanup tasks or release resources associated with the bean. The other options are related to lifecycle methods but do not serve this specific purpose.





Question: The _____ is a specialized form of the @Component annotation intended to represent the application logic in Spring Boot.

Option 1: @Repository

Option 2: @Controller

Option 3: @Service

Option 4: @Configuration




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: In Spring Boot, the "@Service" annotation is a specialized form of the "@Component" annotation used to represent the application's business logic. It helps Spring identify the class as a service component, allowing it to be automatically detected and used within the application context. The other options, such as "@Repository," "@Controller," and "@Configuration," serve different purposes and are not specifically intended for application logic in the same way as "@Service."





Question: In Spring Boot, the _____ annotation can be used to define which beans should be registered in the context based on a conditional check.

Option 1: @ConditionalOnProperty

Option 2: @ConditionalOnClass

Option 3: @ConditionalOnBean

Option 4: @Conditional




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The "@ConditionalOnProperty" annotation in Spring Boot allows you to define conditions under which a bean should be registered in the application context. It checks the specified property and registers the bean if the condition is met. The other options, such as "@ConditionalOnClass," "@ConditionalOnBean," and "@Conditional," serve different conditional registration purposes based on different conditions or criteria.





Question: To manually wire a bean, you would use the _____ method of the ApplicationContext in Spring Boot.

Option 1: getBean()

Option 2: registerBean()

Option 3: wireBean()

Option 4: fetchBean()




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring Boot, to manually wire a bean, you would use the "getBean()" method of the ApplicationContext. This method allows you to retrieve a bean from the Spring container by its name or class. The other options, such as "registerBean()," "wireBean()," and "fetchBean()," do not represent the correct method used for manual bean retrieval and wiring in Spring Boot.





Question: You need to inject a collection of beans in a certain order in your Spring Boot application. How would you ensure the correct order of beans in the injected collection?

Option 1: Use the @Order annotation on each bean and specify an order value for each bean.

Option 2: Use the @Priority annotation on the beans and assign priority values.

Option 3: Use the @Qualifier annotation to specify the order when injecting the collection.

Option 4: The order of bean injection in a collection is determined by the order they are declared in the configuration class.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To ensure the correct order of beans in an injected collection, you can use the @Order annotation on each bean and specify an order value. Spring will then inject the beans in ascending order of their order values. This is a common practice to establish the desired order for beans that need to be injected in a specific sequence.





Question: Imagine you are creating a configuration class in Spring Boot that should only be processed if a certain bean is present in the ApplicationContext. How would you accomplish this?

Option 1: Use the @ConditionalOnBean annotation on the configuration class and specify the required bean's class.

Option 2: Create a custom condition class implementing the Condition interface and specify the condition in the configuration class using @Conditional.

Option 3: Use the @RequiresBean annotation and specify the required bean's name in the configuration class.

Option 4: This behavior is not possible in Spring Boot; configuration classes are always processed regardless of the bean's presence.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To conditionally process a configuration class based on the presence of a certain bean, you can use the @ConditionalOnBean annotation. This annotation ensures that the configuration class is only processed if the specified bean is present in the ApplicationContext. It's a powerful way to control the activation of configuration based on runtime conditions.





Question: You are developing a Spring Boot application where a bean is required to perform a task immediately after the ApplicationContext has been started. How would you implement this?

Option 1: Use the @PostConstruct annotation on the bean's method that needs to run after startup.

Option 2: Implement a custom event listener that listens for the ContextRefreshedEvent and executes the task.

Option 3: Use the @EventListener annotation on a method and specify the event type as ApplicationStartedEvent.

Option 4: Use the @OnStartup annotation on the bean's method.




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: To execute a task immediately after the ApplicationContext has been started in a Spring Boot application, you can implement a custom event listener that listens for the ContextRefreshedEvent. This event is raised when the ApplicationContext is fully initialized and ready to use. You can then execute your task in response to this event.





Question: Which annotation in Spring is used to automate the wiring of bean dependencies?

Option 1: @Autowired

Option 2: @Inject

Option 3: @Bean

Option 4: @Configuration




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring, the @Autowired annotation is used to automate the wiring of bean dependencies. When applied to fields, constructors, or methods, it allows Spring to automatically inject the appropriate beans or dependencies, making the code more readable and reducing the need for manual wiring.





Question: In Spring, what is the process of supplying an external dependency to an object called?

Option 1: Dependency Injection

Option 2: Dependency Wiring

Option 3: Bean Registration

Option 4: Bean Inversion




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The process of supplying an external dependency to an object in Spring is called "Dependency Injection." It involves injecting or providing the required dependencies to an object rather than having the object create them itself, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.





Question: What is the purpose of the @Primary annotation in Spring?

Option 1: Specify the primary bean

Option 2: Mark a bean as deprecated

Option 3: Define a bean's scope

Option 4: Define a bean's name




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The purpose of the @Primary annotation in Spring is to specify the primary bean when multiple beans of the same type exist. When multiple beans qualify as dependencies for injection, the one marked with @Primary is the one that Spring will choose by default. This is useful in scenarios where you have multiple implementations of an interface or class, and one should be considered the primary choice.





Question: How does the @Qualifier annotation assist in Dependency Injection in Spring?

Option 1: It specifies the primary bean to be injected when multiple candidates exist.

Option 2: It resolves circular dependencies in the Spring context.

Option 3: It marks a bean as a prototype, ensuring a new instance is created on each request.

Option 4: It defines a custom scope for a bean.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The @Qualifier annotation in Spring is used to specify the exact bean to be injected when there are multiple candidates of the same type. This helps resolve ambiguity in cases where there are multiple beans of the same type that could be injected. By using @Qualifier with the bean's name, you can explicitly indicate which bean should be injected, ensuring that the correct one is selected. It's particularly useful when you have multiple beans of the same type and need to specify which one should be used for injection.





Question: What is the role of the Init method in the Bean Lifecycle in Spring?

Option 1: It is used to initialize the application context in a Spring Boot application.

Option 2: It is responsible for destroying beans when they are no longer needed.

Option 3: It is executed before the bean is destroyed, allowing for cleanup operations.

Option 4: It is responsible for creating new beans in the Spring context.




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: The Init method, often annotated with @PostConstruct in Spring, plays a crucial role in the bean's lifecycle. It is executed after the bean's construction but before it's put into service. This provides an opportunity to perform initialization tasks, such as setting up resources, establishing database connections, or any other setup required before the bean is used. This method is particularly helpful when you need to ensure that a bean is in a valid and usable state when it's first accessed.





Question: In Spring Framework, what is the difference between @Autowired and @Inject annotations?

Option 1: @Autowired is a Spring-specific annotation, whereas @Inject is a standard Java EE annotation.

Option 2: @Autowired can be used to inject dependencies only by type, while @Inject supports both by type and by name.

Option 3: @Autowired is used to define the scope of a bean, while @Inject is used for constructor injection.

Option 4: @Autowired is used for field injection, while @Inject is used for method injection.




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: The primary difference between @Autowired and @Inject lies in their origin and scope. @Autowired is a Spring-specific annotation and provides more extensive support for resolving and injecting dependencies. It can inject dependencies by type, name, and more, offering a wide range of options. On the other hand, @Inject is part of the Java EE standard and provides basic support for dependency injection by type and name. Typically, @Autowired is the preferred choice in a Spring application for its flexibility and powerful dependency resolution capabilities.





Question: How can you alter the Bean Lifecycle methods in Spring?

Option 1: By extending the BeanFactory class and overriding methods.

Option 2: By modifying the Spring configuration file (XML or JavaConfig).

Option 3: By creating a custom annotation and attaching it to a method.

Option 4: By using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and intercepting bean creation.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: Bean Lifecycle methods in Spring can be altered by extending the BeanFactory class and overriding its methods. This allows you to customize the bean creation process. While other options may be used in Spring configuration or AOP, they do not directly alter the Bean Lifecycle methods themselves.





Question: In a scenario where there are multiple beans of the same type, how can one specify which bean should be Autowired?

Option 1: Use the @Qualifier annotation with the desired bean's name.

Option 2: Use the @Autowired annotation with the desired bean's variable name.

Option 3: Use the @Inject annotation with the desired bean's ID.

Option 4: Use the @Resource annotation with the desired bean's name.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: When there are multiple beans of the same type, you can specify which bean should be autowired using the @Qualifier annotation with the desired bean's name. This helps Spring resolve the ambiguity. The other options, while related to dependency injection, do not directly address the issue of selecting a specific bean from multiple candidates.





Question: What are the considerations and best practices for using @Primary in projects with multiple beans and dependencies?

Option 1: Use @Primary to define a default bean when no qualifier is specified.

Option 2: Avoid using @Primary when there are multiple beans of the same type.

Option 3: Always use @Primary to ensure the bean is selected in all cases.

Option 4: Use @Primary only with setter-based injection, not constructor injection.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In projects with multiple beans and dependencies, @Primary should be used to define a default bean when no qualifier is specified. This provides a clear choice when there is ambiguity. However, it should be used judiciously, especially when there are multiple beans of the same type. It should not be overused, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. The other options do not accurately represent best practices for using @Primary.





Question: In Spring, the process of creating an instance of a bean, wiring it up, and making it available for use is called _____

Option 1: Inversion of Control (IoC)

Option 2: Dependency Injection

Option 3: Aspect-Oriented Programming

Option 4: Bean Configuration




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: In Spring, the process of creating an instance of a bean, wiring it up, and making it available for use is called "Dependency Injection." This core concept of Spring allows for the automatic injection of dependencies into a class, making it more flexible and easier to manage. Inversion of Control (IoC) is a broader concept that encompasses Dependency Injection. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and Bean Configuration are related but not the exact terms used for this specific process.





Question: To resolve ambiguity and specify which bean should be wired when there are multiple beans of the same type, one can use the _____ annotation in Spring

Option 1: @Qualifier

Option 2: @Component

Option 3: @Service

Option 4: @Repository




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To resolve ambiguity when there are multiple beans of the same type, the "@Qualifier" annotation in Spring is used. It allows you to specify which bean should be wired by providing the name or ID of the desired bean. The other annotations, such as "@Component," "@Service," and "@Repository," are used for different purposes, like marking classes for component scanning, but they do not resolve bean wiring ambiguity.





Question: The @Autowired annotation in Spring can be used to autowire bean on the _____

Option 1: Constructor

Option 2: Setter

Option 3: Field

Option 4: Method




Correct Response: 3

Explanation: The "@Autowired" annotation in Spring can be used to autowire a bean on a "Field." This means that Spring will automatically inject the required dependency by setting the field directly. "@Autowired" can also be used on constructors, setters, and methods, but in this specific question, the focus is on field injection. Constructor injection, setter injection, and method injection are other ways to achieve dependency injection in Spring.





Question: In Spring, the _____ annotation is used to indicate that a method should be invoked after the bean has been constructed and injected.

Option 1: @PostConstruct

Option 2: @Autowired

Option 3: @BeanPostProcessor

Option 4: @Inject




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: In Spring, the @PostConstruct annotation is used to indicate that a method should be invoked after the bean has been constructed and injected. It is commonly used for initialization tasks that need to be performed after the bean's dependencies have been injected. The other options, such as @Autowired, @BeanPostProcessor, and @Inject, serve different purposes and are not used for the same scenario.





Question: In cases where a required dependency is not found, the @Autowired annotation will throw a _____.

Option 1: NoSuchBeanDefinitionException

Option 2: BeanCreationException

Option 3: DependencyNotFoundException

Option 4: AutowireException




Correct Response: 2

Explanation: In cases where a required dependency is not found, the @Autowired annotation will throw a BeanCreationException. This exception occurs when Spring cannot find a suitable bean to inject for a required dependency. The other options, such as NoSuchBeanDefinitionException, DependencyNotFoundException, and AutowireException, are not the standard exceptions thrown by @Autowired in this scenario.





Question: The _____ annotation in Spring is used to give a preference to a bean when multiple beans of the same type exist.

Option 1: @Primary

Option 2: @Qualifier

Option 3: @PreferencedBean

Option 4: @Priority




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: The @Primary annotation in Spring is used to give a preference to a bean when multiple beans of the same type exist. It tells Spring which bean should be considered as the primary candidate for autowiring when there are multiple candidates of the same type. The other options, such as @Qualifier, @PreferencedBean, and @Priority, do not serve the same purpose as @Primary.





Question: If you are working on a Spring project where multiple beans of the same type exist, how would you manage the injection of the correct bean into the dependent object, considering best practices and design principles?

Option 1: Use the @Qualifier annotation along with the bean name to specify which bean to inject explicitly.

Option 2: Use the @Resource annotation with the name attribute to specify the bean name for injection.

Option 3: Use the @Autowired annotation with the name attribute to specify the bean name for injection.

Option 4: Let Spring automatically select and inject the bean based on the primary bean definition.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: When multiple beans of the same type exist, the @Qualifier annotation along with the bean name can be used to specify which bean to inject explicitly. This approach adheres to best practices and design principles, providing clear control over bean injection. Using @Resource and @Autowired with name attributes is not the recommended approach, and automatic selection might lead to ambiguity.





Question: Suppose you are developing a large enterprise application using Spring. How would you optimize the bean lifecycle to ensure minimal resource utilization and maximum performance?

Option 1: Implement the SmartInitializingSingleton interface to defer time-consuming initialization tasks until all singletons are created.

Option 2: Use the @Lazy annotation on beans to load them lazily only when they are first accessed.

Option 3: Set the destroy-method attribute in the bean configuration to release resources explicitly during bean destruction.

Option 4: Use the @DependsOn annotation to define bean dependencies explicitly to control their initialization order.




Correct Response: 1

Explanation: To optimize the bean lifecycle in a large enterprise application, implementing the SmartInitializingSingleton interface allows you to defer time-consuming initialization tasks until all singletons are created, minimizing resource utilization during startup. The other options may help in specific cases but don't address the overall lifecycle optimization.





Question: Imagine you are resolving a dependency injection issue in a project. What approach and considerations would you take to resolve ambiguity in autowiring of beans and ensure that the correct bean is injected?

Option 1: Use the @Primary annotation to designate a primary bean for autowiring and resolve ambiguity.

Option 2: Use the @Qualifier annotation to specify the bean name or qualifier to resolve ambiguity.

Option 3: Increase the scope of the bean to singleton to ensure there's only one instance available for autowiring.

Option 4: Use the @Autowired annotation without qualifiers and let Spring choose the best candidate based on the context.
